# Race Conditions and Sync Flow Issues in LibraNote

After analyzing the synchronization mechanism in the LibraNote application, I've identified several potential race conditions and issues in the sync flow. This document outlines the most significant problems that could lead to data inconsistency, UI glitches, or sync failures.

## 1. Concurrent Sync Operations

### Issue: Uncoordinated Multiple Sync Processes

The application has two separate useEffect hooks in the `SyncProvider` that can both trigger synchronization processes:

```typescript
// Initial sync effect
useEffect(
  () => {
    const syncData = async () => {
      // Only start sync if both collections and notes are idle
      if (collectionsSyncStatus !== "idle" || notesSyncStatus !== "idle") {
        return;
      }
      // ... sync logic
    };
    syncData();
  },
  [
    /* dependencies */
  ]
);

// Process new queue items as they are added
useEffect(
  () => {
    const processNewQueueItems = async () => {
      if (
        collectionsSyncStatus !== "synced" ||
        notesSyncStatus !== "synced" ||
        actionQueue.length === 0
      ) {
        return;
      }
      // ... sync logic
    };
    processNewQueueItems();
  },
  [
    /* dependencies */
  ]
);
```

**Race Condition:** There's no mutex or lock mechanism to prevent these processes from running concurrently. If the dependencies of both hooks change rapidly, both hooks could start running their sync processes nearly simultaneously.

## 2. Action Queue Processing Issues

### Issue: Double Processing of Queue Items

The same action queue items could potentially be processed twice:

```typescript
// In first useEffect
for (const item of queueItems) {
  await SyncService.processActionQueueItem(item);
  await SyncService.removeActionQueueItem(item.id);
  await removeActionFromQueue(item.id);
}

// In second useEffect
for (const item of pendingActions) {
  await SyncService.processActionQueueItem(item);
  await SyncService.removeActionQueueItem(item.id);
  await removeActionFromQueue(item.id);
}
```

**Race Condition:** If an item is fetched by both hooks before either one removes it, it could be processed twice, potentially causing duplicate data or errors.

### Issue: Non-Atomic Queue Item Removal

The removal of queue items occurs in separate operations:

```typescript
await SyncService.processActionQueueItem(item);
await SyncService.removeActionQueueItem(item.id); // DB operation
await removeActionFromQueue(item.id); // Store operation
```

**Race Condition:** If the app crashes or encounters an error between these operations, the state could become inconsistent - the item might be removed from the database but not from the store, or vice versa.

## 3. SSE Event Handling Conflicts

### Issue: Uncoordinated SSE Events During Sync

The SSE event handler runs independently of the sync status:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const eventSource = new EventSource("/api/sse");
  eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log("SyncManager: SSE event", event.data);
    SyncService.processSSEEvent(event.data);
  };
  return () => {
    eventSource.close();
  };
}, []);
```

**Race Condition:** If an SSE event arrives during an ongoing sync operation, both processes might try to update the same data simultaneously, leading to potential conflicts. The SSE handler does not check if a sync operation is in progress before making changes.

## 4. Store Global Instance Problems

### Issue: Unsafe Global Store Access

The `SyncService` uses the global store instance without proper null checks:

```typescript
// In SyncService
const store = getStoreInstance()?.getState();
if (store) {
  // Some paths check for store existence
} else {
  // Some paths don't check if store is null
}
```

**Race Condition:** If the store hasn't been initialized yet or becomes unavailable, accessing it could cause errors or missed updates.

## 5. Transaction Isolation Problems

### Issue: Optimistic UI Updates Without Proper Rollback

The store performs optimistic updates before confirming operations:

```typescript
// Add to collections data immediately (optimistic update)
P(set, (draft) => {
  draft.collections.data.push(collection);
});

try {
  // Create in local DB with action
  // ...
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback optimistic update on error
  // ...
}
```

**Race Condition:** If a user performs multiple quick actions on the same entity, the optimistic updates might interfere with each other, leading to UI inconsistencies or incorrect data state.

## 6. Collection and Note Dependencies

### Issue: Orphaned Notes After Collection Operations

When performing operations on collections, related notes might not be properly handled:

```typescript
// In syncRemoteCollectionsToLocal
// Delete collections that are no longer in the remote data
tx.table<Collection>("collections")
  .where("id")
  .noneOf(remoteCollections.map((collection) => collection.id))
  .delete();
```

**Race Condition:** If collections are deleted or replaced, the associated notes might become orphaned if the references aren't updated atomically.

## 7. Synchronization Order Issues

### Issue: Sequential Sync Without Entity Validation

Collections are synced first, then notes:

```typescript
await SyncService.syncRemoteCollectionsToLocal();
setCollectionsSyncStatus("synced");

await SyncService.syncRemoteNotesToLocal();
setNotesSyncStatus("synced");
```

**Race Condition:** There's no verification that all collection references in notes are valid after a sync. If a note refers to a collection that hasn't been synced or was deleted, it could lead to data integrity issues.

## 8. Error Handling Weaknesses

### Issue: Incomplete Error Recovery

Error handling doesn't properly address all potential failure scenarios:

```typescript
try {
  // Sync processes...
} catch (error) {
  console.error("SyncManager: Error during sync process", error);
  setCollectionsSyncStatus("error");
  setNotesSyncStatus("error");
}
```

**Race Condition:** If an error occurs during sync, the system sets error states but doesn't fully recover or retry the operation. This could leave the application in an inconsistent state where some entities were synced and others weren't.

## 9. Concurrency Control Absence

### Issue: No Locking Mechanism

The codebase lacks any concurrency control mechanisms:

**Race Condition:** Multiple components could trigger actions that modify the same entity simultaneously. Without locks or versioning, this could lead to lost updates or data corruption.

## Recommendations

While maintaining the existing architecture, these issues could be addressed through:

1. Implementing a proper mutex/locking mechanism to prevent concurrent sync operations
2. Making queue item processing atomic using transactions
3. Adding coordination between SSE events and sync operations
4. Implementing entity version tracking to detect conflicts
5. Adding proper validation of entity relationships during sync
6. Improving error recovery with automatic retries for failed operations
7. Implementing concurrency control for entity modifications
